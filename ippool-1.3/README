IpPool Software
===============

IpPool is a userspace daemon for managing one or more pools of IP
addresses. It was developed as part of the OpenL2TP project
(http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/openl2tp/) but has since been
repackaged so that it may be used independently of OpenL2TP.

IpPool is not intended for use where DHCP is used. Rather, IpPool
provides a generic IP address allocation mechanism for applications
such as VPN servers which hand out IP addresses to VPN clients.

Planned Work
============

The following features (in priority order) are planned for a future
release:-

- Move usl and cli subdirectories into separate components. They are
  identical to the files released with openl2tp.

Suggested Projects
==================

- A GUI management application using the RPC binary interface. A Java
  application would be ideal, using one of the Java RPC tools to
  implement the API, e.g. http://netbula.com/ or
  http://www.onc-rpc-xdr.com/.

- Make binary packages for the popular Linux distributions,
  e.g. RedHat, SuSE, Debian. Write startup scripts for each which
  would load the pppol2tp kernel module (if appropriate) and start the
  openl2tpd daemon.
