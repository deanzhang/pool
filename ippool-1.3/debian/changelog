ippool (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix version number. Versions 1.1 and 1.2 advertised themselves as
    1.0.

ippool (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the ppp dependency rule in the Debian control file to handle
    the fact that Debian/Ubuntu use a suffix name in the ppp package
    version which breaks our =2.4.4 dependency and prevents clean
    package install on some systems. We now use a combined >=2.4.4 and
    <2.4.5 rule instead of =2.4.4.

ippool (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
 
  * Build with new USL list management code which includes memory
    barriers. This prevents gcc function order optimisations from causing
    problems.
  
  * Enable compiler optimisation.
