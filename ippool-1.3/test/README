This directory contains regression tests of IpPool. In order to run
the tests, ippoold must be built with IPPOOL_TEST enabled. See
../INSTALL for how to do that. The daemon must be run with all
debugging enabled, i.e.

	cd ..
	./ippoold -d

The tests are written using the tcltest package from the tcl
distribution. The easiest way to run the tests is

	make test

in this directory after starting the daemon using the above
method. Results are written to the results/ subdirectory.

When making code changes to IpPool, please re-run the regression
tests before submitting patches.
